# Voice Assistant using Python

This project demonstrates how to build a simple voice assistant using Python, with all code and analysis provided in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

The repository showcases the workflow of developing a voice-activated assistant capable of recognizing and responding to user commands. It covers audio input processing, speech recognition, and response generation, making it suitable for students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in speech-based applications.

## Features

- Audio recording and processing
- Speech recognition using Python libraries
- Command handling and response logic
- Modular and extensible notebook-based code

## Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding and documentation
- **SpeechRecognition**: Speech-to-text conversion
- **PyAudio** or **sounddevice**: Audio recording and playback
- **Python standard libraries**: For logic and utility functions
- **Pandas**: Data handling (if used)
- **Other NLP/speech libraries**: (Optional, e.g., pyttsx3 for text-to-speech)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation
